PhoneGap is a technology that allows you to develop software in HTML and then compile it through the PhoneGap filter so that it comes out the other end in a native application for iPhone, Android, or Windows Phone.   It can be a useful technology if you insist on maintaining a single code base across multiple platforms.

To complete this lab you must:

1. Download PhoneGap

2. Run PhoneGap and host a session.

3. Write some HTML code (the sample HTML code provided in D2L is fine).

4. Download and run an Android emulator.  (here is one option for an emulator: http://www.bluestacks.com)

5. Install the phoneGap produced payload to the emulator.

6. Take a screenshot of that emulation and submit it to the D2L Dropbox.
